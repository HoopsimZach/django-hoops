Quick Note: 
    1. MAKE SURE WHEN YOU COMPILE PLAYER DATA (VITALS, ATTRIBUTES, BADGES, ETC.)
    THAT YOU CAST THE VALUES TO THE CORRECT TYPE (STR, ETC.) BEFORE YOU RETURN THEM.

Quick Idea: 
    HERE THE PLAYER EXPORT PROCESS:
        1. HAVE A PAGE WHERE USER (PERMITTED USERS PREFERABLY) CAN SELECT PLAYERS TO ADD TO DUMP (THROUGH A FORM).
        2. CREATE A ROUTE THAT TAKES A LIST OF PLAYERS AND DUMPS THEIR FORMATTED JSON FILES SO THE USER CAN COPY THEM.
        3. USERS CAN ALSO DUMP FROM A LIST OF PLAYERS WHO HAVE YET TO BE UPGRADED. (IN GAME)
        4. PLAYERS ARE ADDED TO THE LIST REFERENCED IN STEP 3 WHENEVER THEY UPGRADE. (IF THEY ARE NOT IN THE LIST ALREADY)
        5. I WILL NEED TO FORMAT PLAYER DUMPS SO THEY WORK WITH 2KTOOLS --> THIS SHOULD BE QUITE EASY AS IT'S JUST PLUGGING IN VALUES

Todo List: 
    - Finish the 'create a player form' and the 'upgrade form' and add logic to both of them.
    - Finish designing the other pages and making them user-friendly/accessible/good on the eye.
    - Create the export system so that administrators can copy compiled versions of player files that will work with the game.
    - Create the "refresh" system/page so that after the season has been changed in the admin panel/on another page, the league will update.
    - Create a trading system/page so that team managers can trade players that are currently on their roster.
        - There will need to be a few pages:
            - Sent Trades (locate this into the sending teams Record)
            - Trade Offers (locate this into the receiving teams Record)
            - Create Trade (this is just a page that has a form that allows managers to create trades)
                - It should pre-load all of the players on both teams.
                - You will have to use javascript for this, because it'll need to load the players each time the user chooses a new team
                    to trade with.
    - Create a page for administrators to add a manager to a team, maybe?
        - Could even have assistant managers?
        - This may be easy considering once you login to the admin panel, you are authenticated with that account on the main pages too.
    - Add daily rewards that users can collect (or automatically be given on an interval).
        - Maybe even add streaks?

Quick Note:
    HERE IS THE PROCESS FOR ADDING CONTRACTS TO PLAYERS:
        1. Use the admin panel to create new entries in the JSON.
            OR.
        1. Create a page where administrators can add contracts to players.
        2. Find the current season's number from the configuration (use the first configuration -- should be the only one in the whole table).
        3. Take data for each season in the contract, to get the number for other seasons, increment the current season's number.
        4. Make sure users cannot add more seasons to a player than the "contract_years_max" variable listed in the league configuration file. 

Quick Note:
    HERE IS HOW WE WOULD MOVE TO A NEW SEASON:
        1. Simply change the season in the admin panel to the new season.
        2. Create a page that would "refresh" the league.
        3. All the "refresh" would do is:
            - Check if players have a contract for the new season, if they don't, it will make them free agents.
