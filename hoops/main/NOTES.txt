Quick Note: 
    1. MAKE SURE WHEN YOU COMPILE PLAYER DATA (VITALS, ATTRIBUTES, BADGES, ETC.)
    THAT YOU CAST THE VALUES TO THE CORRECT TYPE (STR, ETC.) BEFORE YOU RETURN THEM.

Quick Idea: 
    HERE THE PLAYER EXPORT PROCESS:
        1. HAVE A PAGE WHERE USER (PERMITTED USERS PREFERABLY) CAN SELECT PLAYERS TO ADD TO DUMP (THROUGH A FORM).
        2. CREATE A ROUTE THAT TAKES A LIST OF PLAYERS AND DUMPS THEIR FORMATTED JSON FILES SO THE USER CAN COPY THEM.
        3. USERS CAN ALSO DUMP FROM A LIST OF PLAYERS WHO HAVE YET TO BE UPGRADED. (IN GAME)
        4. PLAYERS ARE ADDED TO THE LIST REFERENCED IN STEP 3 WHENEVER THEY UPGRADE. (IF THEY ARE NOT IN THE LIST ALREADY)
        5. I WILL NEED TO FORMAT PLAYER DUMPS SO THEY WORK WITH 2KTOOLS --> THIS SHOULD BE QUITE EASY AS IT'S JUST PLUGGING IN VALUES

Todo List: 
    - Finish the 'create a player form' and the 'upgrade form' and add logic to both of them.
    - Finish designing the other pages and making them user-friendly/accessible/good on the eye.
    - Create the export system so that administrators can copy compiled versions of player files that will work with the game.

Quick Note:
    HERE IS THE PROCESS FOR ADDING CONTRACTS TO PLAYERS:
        1. Use the admin panel to create new entries in the JSON.
            OR.
        1. Create a page where administrators can add contracts to players.
        2. Find the current season's number from the configuration (use the first configuration -- should be the only one in the whole table).
        3. Take data for each season in the contract, to get the number for other seasons, increment the current season's number.
        4. Make sure users cannot add more seasons to a player than the "contract_years_max" variable listed in the league configuration file. 

Quick Note:
    HERE IS HOW WE WOULD MOVE TO A NEW SEASON:
        1. Simply change the season in the admin panel to the new season.
        2. Create a page that would "refresh" the league.
        3. All the "refresh" would do is:
            - Check if players have a contract for the new season, if they don't, it will make them free agents.
